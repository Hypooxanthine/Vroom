 * @brief The Event struct is a standardized event structure that will gather all the events that can be triggered by the engine.

 * @warning Please be careful when dealing with event values (mouseX, scrollY, newWidth, ...). This struct was meant to be lightweight, so event values are stored in a union. Only the values that are relevant to the event type will be meaningful.
