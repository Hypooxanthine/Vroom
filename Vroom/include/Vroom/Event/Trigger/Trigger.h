/**
 * @page triggers Triggers
 * A trigger is a particular type of event that can be activated and deactivated.
 * For this reason, it only works with inputs that can be pressed (activation) and released (deactivation).
 * A trigger can be bound with multiple inputs and callbacks.
 * For example, a trigger could be "MoveForward". When keys Q or Up arrow are pressed, the trigger is activated.
 * When the trigger is activated, and then Q and Up arrow aren't pressed anymore, the trigger is unactivated.
 * Whenever a trigger is activated or deactivated, all associated callbacks are called with a boolean value 
 * (activated / deactivated).
